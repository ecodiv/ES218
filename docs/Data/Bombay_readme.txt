% This file contains an extracted local summary of land-surface 
% temperature results produced by the Berkeley Earth averaging 
% method for the location: 
% 
%    18.48 N, 72.68 E
% 
% The Berkeley Earth method takes temperature observations from a large 
% collection of weather monitoring stations and produces an estimate of 
% the underlying global temperature field across all of the Earth's 
% land areas.  Once this temperature field has been generated, it is 
% possible to estimate the temperature evolution of individual locations 
% simply by sampling the field at the locaiton in question.  This 
% file contains such a local estimate.
% 
% Temperatures are in Celsius. Uncertainties represent the 95% confidence 
% interval for statistical noise and spatial undersampling effects.  Such 
% uncertainties are expected to account for the effects of random 
% noise as well as random biases affecting station trends and random 
% shifts in station baselines.  The analysis framework is expected to be 
% robust against most forms of bias; however, the impact of some forms of 
% possible systematic bias is still being studied.

% The current dataset presented here is described as: 
% 
%   Berkeley Earth analysis for mean temperature on complete dataset
% 
% 
% This analysis was run on 12-Oct-2013 00:45:15
% 
% Global results are based on 39348 time series 
%   with 15244148 data points
% 
% The current location is characterized by: 
%   Country: India
%   Nearby Cities: Bombay, Thana, Kalyan, Bhiwandi, Ulhasnagar, Ambarnath, Panvel
%   Percent water in local neighborhood: 64.9 %
%   Temperature stations within 200 km: 4
%   Temperature obeservations within 200 km: 4567
% 
% Note that all results reported here are derived from the full field 
% analysis and may use information from stations a great distance from the 
% target location when more local sources are not available.  In general, 
% the temperature anomaly field has significant correlation extending over 
% greater than 1000 km, which allows even distant stations to provide some 
% insight at times when local coverage may be lacking. 
% 
% 
% Values are reported as missing (i.e. NaN) when station coverage near 
% this location becomes too low.  Time averages over intervals with some 
% missing data will be reported as long as at least 75% of the necessary 
% values are available.
